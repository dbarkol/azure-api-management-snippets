<!--
    This sample demonstrates how to use Azure RBAC to authenticate to a
    a cognitive service. 
    
    The policy will use the managed identity of API Management to retrieve 
    an access token from Azure AD. The access token is then used to 
    authenticate to the service.

    For Azure OpenAI, the Cognitive Services User role is required to access 
    the service.

    For more information on built-in roles for cognitive services, see:
